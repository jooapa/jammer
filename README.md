![banner](.github/img/banner3.png)

## Introduction

Tired of opening up a browser or app to play music, and even then you can't
play local files or songs from different sites?

Jammer is a simple CLI music player that supports playing songs from your **local files**, **Youtube** and **Soundcloud**.

Compatible with **`Windows`**, *`Linux`*.

***Jammer shines its best when using it as a playlist. That's why I created it,
for the playlist feature across different platforms***

- The player doesn't stream the songs, but downloads them to local storage.
- The Jammer folder is located in the user's home directory and contains the
  downloaded songs, playlists, settings, keybinds, locales and effects modification.
- Jammer uses [Bass](https://www.un4seen.com/) for playing the songs and [ManagedBass](https://github.com/ManagedBass/ManagedBass) for being able to use it in .NET, [SoundCloudExplode](https://github.com/jerry08/SoundCloudExplode), [YoutubeExplode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) for downloading the songs and [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console) for the UI.

```

On **Windows**, you need to add the libraries to the executable folder.

dotnet publish -r win10-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:DefineConstants="CLI_UI" --self-contained
```

```bash
dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:UseForms=false -p:DefineConstants="CLI_UI" --self-contained
```
